# Lab Task - 1

## Creating files and folders

- Inside the `/tmp/` folder, create a new folder called `test <roll-number>` (replace `<roll-number>` with your roll number)
    Example:
        - If your roll number is `123456`, then the folder name should be `test 123456`
        *NOTE*: There is a space between `test` and `123456`

- Inside the `test <roll-number>` folder, create a new file called `test.txt` and write the following text in it:

```text
This is a test file
```

> It is highly encouraged that you use new ways to write contents into a file and even trying to create a file without using the `touch` command.

## Creating users and groups

- Create a new user called `kali-auto-user`, set its password to `test123`, and add it to the `sudo` group. Also, ensure that the home directory of this user is `/var/kali-auto-user`

- Create a new group called `kali-auto-group` and add the `kali-auto-user` user to this group.
