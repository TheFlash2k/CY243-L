# Deployment

---

All the automation scripts and setup files will be pasted in this directory as the course progresses.

This folder is meant to make it easier for Lab Engineers to deploy their Lab Environments without actually having to worry about setting up robust VMs and everything.
However, the pre-requisite to understand the deployment and modification phase is the know-how of the following technologies

- Docker and Docker-Compose
- Vagrant
- Ansible
- Bash

If the instructor has the knowledge about these technologies then modifying each lab according to the students will be a piece of cake.

For quizzes, I'll make use of CTFd to host quiz; either locally or remotely and then each quizes' data can easily be exported into a .csv format and can easily be graded. I also will be making a script to automate this task, those scripts will be placed in the `/scripts` directory.
