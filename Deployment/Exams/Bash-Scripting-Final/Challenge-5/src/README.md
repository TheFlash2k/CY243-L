# Question - 5

Write a simple bash script called `even_odd.sh` that resides in `/usr/share/` that does the following:

- Reads in a number from command line argument (`$1`)
- Prints whether the number is even or odd.

> Make sure to only print either `even` or `odd`. Any other output will automatically be discarded and won't give the flag.
