# Question - 3

Write a simple bash script called `ip-checker.sh` that resides in `/home/cy102l/` that does the following:
- Extract the ip address of an interface.
- The interface will be passed as input from command-line i.e. arguments (`$1`)

| MAKE SURE TO NOT PRINT ANYTHING. `checker` will perform an exact match.

> **NOTE**:
All of this has to be done from the bash script, even if you do it manually, it won't work.
Also, you don't need to switch to another user, the `checker` will handle each case automatically
