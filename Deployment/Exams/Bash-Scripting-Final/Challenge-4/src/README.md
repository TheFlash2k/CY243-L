# Question - 4

Write a simple bash script called `find_occurances.sh` that resides in `/home/cy102l/` that does the following:
- Reads in data from `/opt/random-data.txt`
- Iterates over the content, and counts the number of three-lettered word in each file.
- Prints the number to be matched by `checker`

| Make sure to only print the number of occurances, and nothing else.

> **NOTE**:
All of this has to be done from the bash script, even if you do it manually, it won't work.
Also, you don't need to switch to another user, the `checker` will handle each case automatically
