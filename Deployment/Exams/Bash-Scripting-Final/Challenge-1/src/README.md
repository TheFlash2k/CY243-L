# Question - 1

Write a simple bash script called `q1.sh` that resides in `/home/cy102l/question-1` that does the following when invoked:

- Creates a new user called `ashfaq`
- Sets and creates the home directory of `ashfaq`: `/usr/share/ashfaq`
- Sets the shell of ashfaq to be `/bin/bash`

> **NOTE**:
All of this has to be done from the bash script, even if you do it manually, it won't work.
Also, you don't need to switch to another user, the `checker` will handle each case automatically
